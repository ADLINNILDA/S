            "* **Date:** While the exact date of Jesus's birth is unknown, the church fixed it as December 25th in the 4th century, coinciding with the winter solstice in the Roman Empire. Some Eastern Christian Churches celebrate on January 7th due to using the Julian calendar.\n",
            "* **Traditions:** Christmas traditions are a blend of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular customs. Popular traditions include gift-giving, Advent calendars, Christmas music and caroling, movies, Nativity plays, Christmas cards, church services, special meals, and decorations like trees, lights, and nativity scenes.  Figures like Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind are associated with bringing gifts to children.\n",
            "* **Economic Impact:** Christmas is a significant economic driver, with increased sales for retailers and businesses during the holiday season.\n",
            "* **Etymology:** The word \"Christmas\" comes from \"Christ's Mass.\"  \"Xmas\" is an abbreviation based on the Greek letter Chi (Χ), the first letter of Christ in Greek.\n",
